NEST WEALTH - SUDOKU

What I used:

-HTML5
-CSS3
-jQuery

What it does:

-Stores puzzle answers in a javascript object
-Stores available hints in an array of strings
-Iterates through array of hints, finds correct cell and adds the hint
-Clicking on empty cell activates input field
-Only numbers are allow, other characters are discarded
-Hint button diabled by default
-If there answers are entered, hint button is no longer disabled
-If answers are entered, hint button is enabled
-Reset button clears all answers and disables hint button
-Upon completetion of the puzzle:
 -If there are errors, they are shown same as when hint button is clicked
 -If there are no errors, the puzzle is complete and user is congradulated
